# Feature Flag Solutions

## What are Feature Flags?

`Feature Flags` are a technique in software development that allows to modify runtime behavior without changing code. It decouples the releasing of functionality to the end users from the roll-out of the binaries.
`Feature Flags` work like a switch or toggle and are therefore often called `Feature Toggles` or `Feature Switches` because of there Boolean nature. But `Feature Flags` can have many different use cases and can be more complex than a toggle. Thatâ€™s why the tern Feature Flag is more suitable.
